# bytebeats
Arduino (Arduboy/Midiboy) sketch demonstrating the sound and vision of bytebeats muzak.

Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtQdIYUtAHg and launched with: http://wurstcaptures.untergrund.net/music/

On the the Midiboy (blokas.io thanks for this!) or Arduboy, Use the four direction buttons to change the formula. 

Keeping holding the button to display the formula being used.

Use the A & B buttons to increase/decrease the tempo.

If you hold the A or B buttons while selecting with the direction buttons, you select a formula from a different bank (three banks of four).

I plan to make formula loading from files
